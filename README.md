# Weather_App
The Real-Time Weather App is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an external API. It provides users with up-to-date weather information for any city they input
-> Technologies Used:
    HTML: Defines the structure of the app.
    CSS: Styles the user interface for a clean and intuitive look.
    JavaScript: Handles data retrieval and dynamic content updates.
    API (Application Programming Interface): Connects to an external weather service to fetch real-time weather data.
->App Features:
    Input Field: Users can enter the name of any city they want to check the weather for.  
    Search Button: Initiates the weather data retrieval process.
->Display Area:
    City Name: Shows the name of the selected city.
    Temperature: Displays the current temperature in Celsius.
    Weather Description: Provides a brief description of the weather conditions (e.g., “partly cloudy,” “rainy,” etc.).
->How It Works:
    When the user enters a city name and clicks the “Search” button, the app sends a request to the weather API.
    The API responds with real-time weather data for the specified city.
    The app then updates the display area with the retrieved information.
->Code Overview:
    The HTML file defines the app’s structure, including input fields and placeholders.
    CSS styles enhance the visual appeal, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
    JavaScript handles the API request, processes the data, and updates the display dynamically.
->Next Steps:
    Customize the app further by adding additional features, such as a 5-day forecast or weather icons.
    Consider improving error handling (e.g., displaying a message if the city name is not found).
    Remember to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key when implementing the API integration.
